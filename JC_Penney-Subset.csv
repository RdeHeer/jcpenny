We have TMJ & suffer with the effects....headaches, neck & shoulder pain....I had an Orthopedic Pillow & needed a new one & I knew our daughter was needing one too. We also like the \""cool\"" aspect of this pillow; such a nice addition for older women with hot flashes! The pillow is a little softer than what I expected, but it still helps. It has a nice pillow cover to protect the pillow itself, nicer than others I've seen. It does have a little odor, as others have mentioned, but the smell lessens with time airing out. Our daughter noticed it too, but it didn't bother her & I expected it would, as she is very sensitive. She too, loves her new pillow! The pillow does still have a slight odor even after having it for awhile now, but I like to spray a lavender scent on my pillow at night & that seems to help too. (I spray it only on the pillow case, not the pillow itself.) I also like the warranty of 5 years.""}, {""review_2""=>""I really wanted to like this pillow. I own older 10 year old version of this pillow and I loved it. Over the years it started to disintegrate. This pillow is Visco-elastic memory foam which is filler to memory to keep it from sinking down. Real memory that has memory is polyurethane foam. I didn't know that at the time of ordering. I guess they added the filler because of customers complaining of memory pillows flattening down while sleeping; which is true for memory foam. Good ones are high density. This one on the other side has no memory. You apply pressure and it returns right back. It feels more like high density foam from the craft store. It does not form around your head. I'm 6' tall side sleeper and when I put my neck on the pillow pillow is fighting it back into unnatural position. I tried to push it back with my neck to keep it in natural position. Then it gives me neck pressure and headache. For 3 months me and my husband tried to sleep on this pillow and it ended on the floor every time. It is excellent for back support when watching TV. The pillow has no cooling feature. The cooling is on the upper side of pillowcase only. So you can take it off and put it on better feeling pillow. The pillow looks good and has no chemical smell. Now, if you have just the right distance of the neck versus head, this pillow just might be it for you. For us it didn't happen.""}, {""review_3""=>""For the average person, this would probably be ab excellent pillow. But, I have arthritis in 4 discs in my neck, so I haved a lot of pain when trying to sleep. I have used a pillow purchased from my chiropractor that I wanted to replace since it's a few years old, so I was hoping this would be a good replacement. Back to the chiropractor to get another from him instead. This one was just a bit too firm, and gave me a headache if I laid on my back. Problems on side as well as the center of the pillow is not quite low enough and didn't keep me aligned correctly. . If it had been just a little bit softer with a little deeper center, it would have been perfect. The quality is very good in both the pillow and cover.""}, {""review_4""=>""I was hesitant to drop what I considered big bucks on a pillow but after waking up almost every morning with a kink in my neck and a blinding headache, I took the plunge. I normally slept on 2 pillows and I still use an extra flatter pillow under this one but it has made an incredible difference in my sleep.""}, {""review_5""=>""The first thing I noticed was that it smelled pretty bad - like commercial processing but the packaging warns you of this and after airing it out for 3-4 days it smells just fine now. The second thing I noticed was how wonderfully cool it felt - no need to flip it like the old ones. The wave form supports my neck and also prevents me from slipping off the pillow (which I did when using my old pillows - hence crick in neck). I give it all AAAs. No neck pain, no headaches! You won't be disappointed.""}, {""review_6""=>""The pillow provides perfect neck alignment and an excellent night's sleep. Using standard pillows my neck would be stiff and achy. This is the first pillow that facilitates true comfort and relaxation and the cool feel is pleasant regardless of the temperature outside. I purchased a set for the master bed and the kids fell in love with them so I took advantage of discounts and purchased them for the kids' beds as well. Love the pillows -- wish they sold replacement covers, but the company won't budge.""}, {""review_7""=>""I bought this as a replacement for a similar pillow I have had for several years. I am very happy with it. The fit when I am in side-lying keeps my shoulder from hurting. I use a standard pillow case over the one provided for ease in keeping it oil free. And I like a smother finish to keep bed head to a minimum.""}, {""review_8""=>""I wanted a pillow with the cooling effect along with being contour for my husband.

He's had them for a few months now and they still look as good as they did the day I bought them.

They are perfect for business casual at work, and can also be worn on a date or in a casual setting. They fit me very true to size. After MANY washes, they have only faded a VERY slight amount, and they have not shown any of the normal signs of wear -- fraying, pockets thinning, seams popping. I absolutely love these pants, and strongly recommend them to anyone. The only thing I would recommend is that SJB offer a style with an adjustable waistband, if they don't already.""}, {""review_8""=>""Actually, I made 3 different purchases recently.

Employees all should be as nice and helpful as she was. My grandson needed black pants for work and although we liked the St. Johns Bay, they didn't have his size. I purchased a pair of Levis in black and when I got home I ordered the St. Johns Bay on line. They came in the time specified and they fit great....my grandson really liked them. I went back another day and purchased a similar style St. Johns Bay for his brother as he needs them for a Sweet 16. All those who helped me were helpful, courteous and a credit to JC Penneys.

I have worn Alfred Dunner clothes for years. They seemed to fit me better than most others. Lately, I've had to by-pass them in the store or return them when ordered online because they almost seem like a completely different product. The quality is not as good as it once was. It seems they are skimping on the material as the last few pairs I have tried on have been slightly smaller than those in my closet. I haven't relied on how they fit, but actually measured them against the ones I already have. The length, however, is another story. While I used to get by with just wearing them on the long side, the last few pairs I purchased of a different line had to be taken to the seamstress to be shortened. I realize at just over 5 foot that I'm short, but when they are 6 inches too long I don't see how they qualify as \""short\"".

The country of origin has not changed either. The only thing that has changed is the pattern shape.Finally analysis: The new pattern sits higher on the waist, is longer on the length, and slimmer on the leg.If this is how the pants are going to continue I will be taking them off my favorites list because nobody should have to shimmy into their clothes-ever.""}, {""review_9""=>""These pants are fantastic for exercise or dance.

Pair these pants with a cute top and a pair of heels and you are all set for work. They have about an inch that you can let down easily from the hem if you want a little extra length. I did that and that makes them perfect on me, hitting right at the ankle. They wash and dry perfectly, and need only a light ironing before wearing.""}, {""review_9""=>""These pants are great, I purchased some last year, and purchased some of the new colors this year. The fabric is a good weight, not like a jersey, but like the weight of cotton and give them body. I would prefer if they were a polyester/nylon/spandex blend, as the rayon/nylon/spandex blend does tend to wrinkle a bit more. The teaberry bubble has a design in the fabric, that resembles a pique or diamond, and the color is like a bright coral, very pretty. The others are a plain fabric. The fit is nice and figure flattering with more of a slim straight leg. Can be dressed up or down depending on what top you wear and how you accessorize. Sizing is pretty much true to size.""}]}"

Then I didn't use it for a couple of months until this past weekend when again I baked chicken it. I turned the chicken halfway through the cooking time and then sometime after that and before the time was up I heard a popping sound which sounded like grease splattering but then when it was time to take the chicken out I opened the oven and the dish had cracked/split into two pieces! Now the use instructions warn that drastic temperature changes can cause the dish to crack such as when you take a hot dish and pour cold water in it, etc... but the dish never left the oven. When I turned the chicken I simply pulled the oven rack out never touching the dish and turned the chicken never touching any part of the dish nor did I add any liquid or anything else to the pan before pushing the rack back in and closing the door. Now if opening the oven door for no more than a minute would be considered to cause a \""drastic temperature change\"" then this product shouldn't be on the market.

Now let me get to the disappointment.. I wear a size 34x30 and they fir just a tad bit loose but when washed that problem is gone, with that being said since iI already know my size I just got the pair of the grey black 3D color. when i got home and decide to put them on I was in so much shock to see how huge they where on me! this 34 size waist fit like a 36 waist maybe even a 38 because the stretch. whats up with that? arent all 34 waist jeans from levis supposed to be the same fit? looked further into this issue and found out that the color, GREY BLACK 3D, is not actually a pair of jeans because it is 65%cotton, 33%polyester, and 2%elastane. so in my opinion this is not a pair of jeans its not denim or 100%cotton and for the price you could get other levis 100% cotton. i do love the 508 line but ill stick to the 508's that are 100% cotton and better quality in my opinion- a few are british khaky, rigid envy, etc.. those are 508's and are 100%cotton. if you get any other color with the mix of 3 material build i suggest you get a size down as i am going to exchange my 34x30 pair for a 32x30 and that should do they trick. im still very confused by this odd sizing for the 508 line. I will include a picture so you can see what im saying. the pair in question will be at the bottom,which is not 100%cotton and the 100%cotton pair of 508's will be at the top so you can see how much bigger the ones that are not 100%cotton are. keep in mind they are both 508's 34Wx30L so they should be exactly the same... look at how much of the grey black 3D pair stick out from under the all 100%cotton 508 on top, which is true to size.""}, {""review_3""=>""They weren't really the correct size, they said 40 but they were more like 38""}, {""review_4""=>""I bought my first pair of Levi 508 and absolutely loved the fit.

You can find great fitting jeans that will be on par fit-wise to these jeans for a third of the price. The reason I keep buying them? They look GOOD. Those other jeans fit well but they don't have the same appeal as these jeans. I'm a jeans kind of guy, but I know that these jeans stand out from the rest, allowing me to stand out in a crowd even when that crowd is also wearing jeans. That's why when my first pair of these jeans got too faded (from wearing them way too much, not the jeans fault at all), I ordered another pair of the exact same jeans. They're my go-to pair for events where I need to look good but can get away with not wearing dressier pants.""}, {""review_8""=>""I have always worn Levi 512 until they stopped making them, I looked and tried several styles and brands, not really finding anything that came close to the 512's. They were either too baggy in the legs, or if I got skinny jeans thet sat too low at the waist and uncomfortable for me as I'm in a wheelchair. I came across the 508's and read the description which sounded like the perfect fit for me, a normal fit in seat and waist and a tapered leg which is what I like. Bought a pair to try for fit and feel, they were perfect ! Bought two more since, these are now my replacement jeans for the 512's, in fact these would be better than the 512's if only they made them in the heavier denim rather than the new thin stuff they now use.

The color is just as pictured and exactly as I hoped. The color is identical in all three sets (no dye lot issues), and they are holding the color well after four washings. I always use white vinegar in my rinse water, instead of fabric softener, so maybe that helped with the color retention. These towels are not super thick nor ultra plush, but are just right. (I have owned ultra thick towels and I do not like them because they seem more difficult to dry off with, and, they take up a lot of space both in the linen closet and in the washer/dryer). These are not thin either; they are a mid-weight towel which very slightly lean toward a lighter weight towel (if you are comparing to the ultra plush, ultra expensive type towels). The decorative bands woven into these towels did NOT shrink at all (I've had that happen before with other non-JCP expensive towels, causing a great deal of puckering). These are well-priced, but getting them on sale made them an excellent value. I am VERY happy with my JCP Home towels and will likely buy more.""}, {""review_2""=>""Bought these to redecorate a bath and for daily use.

I don't want to be pulling on my jeans all day. I prefer a more substantial feel to my jeans also--I didn't like the very thin extra stretchy feeling of the jeans.

The first few uses I had a bit of difficulty cleaning the pan, but then I read a fantastic hint for cleaning grill pans in the Food Network Magazine. After use, let the pan cool completely. Then sprinkle with Kosher salt and use a damp sponge that has a mild abrasive side. Scrub the pan lightly until clean and then rinse and dry. Voila!! the pan is like new. I would definitely recommend this pan, along with this cleaning technique. I forgot to mention that the red looks fantastic with the décor in my kitchen so it never has to be hidden in a cupboard!!""}}"

The country of origin has not changed either. The only thing that has changed is the pattern shape.Finally analysis: The new pattern sits higher on the waist, is longer on the length, and slimmer on the leg.If this is how the pants are going to continue I will be taking them off my favorites list because nobody should have to shimmy into their clothes-ever.""}, {""review_8""=>""I absolutely LOVE these pants.I have 3 pairs of black and 3 pairs of gray.

I purchased ( separate purchases - one in the store and one pair ordered at Penney's online site) two pairs of jeans in the indigo color, and I washed them before wearing. A few hours after putting on the first pair of jeans, my fingers and hands looked blue. The color was coming off on my skin and on the surfaces of chairs and the car seat. Furthermore, the material was covered with lint even though I could not locate a source for the lint. I tried wearing the second pair of jeans, and I experienced the same results. After using a lint roller and washing the pants two more times, I was hoping the problems had been solved. Instead, less dye was coming off on my skin and other objects, but the material attracted even more profuse amounts of lint. Needless to say, it was embarrassing to be seen in pants covered with lint pieces of various sizes. In order to keep up with the amount of lint the material attracts, I had to use a lint roller multiple times within an hour. I am quite unhappy. I have never experienced problems such as these with any other brand of jeans.

The tall worked out to be the perfect length for me to be able to wear them as long pants.""}, {""review_6""=>""In the meantime, a friend of mine saw them, loved them and tried them on.... she is tall and likes to wear Capri and ankle pants to work.

FYI the only reason I have two sets of most colors is because I wore some when I was pregnant all the way until the last day and I feel they stretched some but that was my fault and these actually wash extremely well. I wear one almost every single day and have had each one for at least three years (some five) and the fabric looks and feels brand new. I will agree with other reviewers that I would buy even more in other colors too. Make sure to get these on sale and they will pay for themselves VERY quickly.""}, {""review_6""=>""I ordered the Large/XL and they did not even come close to fitting.

I wanted a classic stretchy body hugging smooth not confining fit that would not cling to sheer tops but could be worn alone. That's not to much to ask so I thought. Then I found the Worthington Seamless Cami and my search was over. Never again will I need to look any further this one is just right. I bought both the regular and petite size (fits about 1-1/2 inches shorter) in several colors. The best Cami ever and what a great price!!!""}]}"

The picture on the box and how it is supposed to look, all three of the roasters that I received does not look like the picture.

I purchased ( separate purchases - one in the store and one pair ordered at Penney's online site) two pairs of jeans in the indigo color, and I washed them before wearing. A few hours after putting on the first pair of jeans, my fingers and hands looked blue. The color was coming off on my skin and on the surfaces of chairs and the car seat. Furthermore, the material was covered with lint even though I could not locate a source for the lint. I tried wearing the second pair of jeans, and I experienced the same results. After using a lint roller and washing the pants two more times, I was hoping the problems had been solved. Instead, less dye was coming off on my skin and other objects, but the material attracted even more profuse amounts of lint. Needless to say, it was embarrassing to be seen in pants covered with lint pieces of various sizes. In order to keep up with the amount of lint the material attracts, I had to use a lint roller multiple times within an hour. I am quite unhappy.

With all the jeans that I've tried, there has been enough sag in the seat to carry my laptop and enough bag in the thighs to look like a flag flapping in the breeze. A men's style and clothing website recommended these jeans as impressive, and I decided to take their advice. However, I decided to try the slim fit tapered leg due to my problems with previous jeans contrary to the website recommendation. I have never worn a slim jean figuring that they were generally for younger much more slender customers. The Lee sizes though gave me the opportunity to try them. It's remarkable. The fit is perfection. I washed them several times to remove any excess dye [to protect my dress shirts and blazers], and they still fit perfectly. Just ordered two more pairs, because nothing this good can last forever. Someone in a suite is going to want to change things, and this perfect fit will be gone.""}, {""review_2""=>""I am so happy that Lee not only started offering slim fit jeans, but now they have slim tapered leg jeans ... even better for a short, relative thin person like me.

Finally, a jean that I feel really good in ... and at a very reasonable price too. Thanks, Lee!""}]}"

I complained and Keurig sent the K2.0 350 as a replacement. No better! They sent out a K2.0 300. It was the same. Took way over 2 minutes to brew a cup. In the meantime, as I am complaining to family and friends about the lengthy brew time, they informed me, three of them, that the K2.0 200 worked like a charm and delivered coffee quickly! As I called again about the horrible performance of the K2.0 300, Keurig graciously offered to upgrade to the more expensive model. I immediately said \""No, just send me the cheaper one, the K2.0 200, because I know this one has a good track record.\"" This model works the best! Believe me!!!

After years of using my old Keurig Mini , I was excited to get the new 2.0. Bottom line, I went back to using my old keurig mini after about 2 weeks. Nothing I do removes the burnt plastic taste from my coffee. I have soaked all removable parts (water reservoir, k-cup holder, etc) in white vineagar over night, spent an hour running white vinegar and water cleanses through the machine, and I even washed all the removable parts in the dishwasher (something you're not supposed to do but it was my last resort). Nothing I do removes the plastic taste and smell. Everything I try to brew is undrinkable. Reading the reviews from other 2.0 owners, I see I am not the only one drinking coffee that tastes like a burnt barbie doll. I have been a loyal customer for years, and even recruited my parents to the brand (my mom owns a coffee shop so this was quiet a feat), but I am now fearful of the plastic being used in the new 2.0 brewers.

I was familiar with Keurig's however because we've always had one at work. First thing I realized: there aren't 9 sizes as advertised! I was excited about making a larger cup of coffee... but no go. Second the machine is loud. Why? And since I can only make a 10oz cup, why do I have to put so much water into the water reservoir? Lastly, what's the deal with the filter that is in the package, but mentioned no where in the instructions? So weird and incomplete.

ORIGINAL=10\"".The NEW Slim-Fit cut is 1/2\"" more narrow than the ORIGINAL (N=8-1/4\"" at knee vs O=8-3/4\"" at the knee).The fabric content has not changed so I do not understand the difference in the feel of the fabric but it does feel thinner, cheaper. The country of origin has not changed either. The only thing that has changed is the pattern shape.Finally analysis: The new pattern sits higher on the waist, is longer on the length, and slimmer on the leg.If this is how the pants are going to continue I will be taking them off my favorites list because nobody should have to shimmy into their clothes-ever.""}, {""review_9""=>""These pants are fantastic for exercise or dance.

It is so cute! And it fit in perfectly with my decor and the space I had available ton my counter.Unfortunately, the popcorn and the process of making the popcorn were a big disappointment.First off the popcorn: the popped corn was tough and there were as many old maids as there were popped kernals. It made a VERY small batch, one in which you had to be on your guard while eating in order to maintain all of your teeth.Second the machine itself: Even though we used the measuring cups for the oil and popcorn, the machine \""clogged\"" up while popping and we had to stop it and clean out the popper during the popping process.Also, it was very crowded inside the machine itself just to access the inner kettle in order to get the oil and the kernals loaded without spilling all over.It was also tricky to remove the popcorn from the machine without grabbing each handful. Cleanup: difficult, as there is no pan or anything to remove, you just have to go in and remove all the old maids, etc. by hand and then wipe down with a rag.We tried four batches, but all four were lousy.I would not recommend this product unless you just want it for display. It's very cute!""}, {""review_3""=>""I have been wanting one of these for so long - I had the extra 20% off coupon so i bought it. Got it home, bought popcorn and oil and unboxed it. My kids were so excited. It turned and turned and nothing. We shut it off, turned it back on and finally we could hear the sizzle and 'pop' 'pop' - more kernels shot out then popped corn. Kids got their popcorn, needed to make 2 batches for 3 kids (18, 11, 9 yr). Popcorn was a little chewy - but expected -not like air popped. It was easy clean up - while wiping down the plastic walls, there were these melted spots where the the hot kernels hit the walls. I only could envision it after 5 more uses... a popcorn popper with chicken pox. It went back. Great idea - I would have paid a little more for glass walls.""}, {""review_4""=>""I got this as a gift for my boyfriend for xmas! He loves popcorn! It was very easy to put together and really easy to use. 2 things I would want to mention is that there are little vent slits on both sides to let the heat out. The kernels and little pieces of popcorn shoot out of these slits while it's popping. Which I don't really mind, I just pick them up afterwards. The second and biggest issue I have is that its kind of hard to clean. The metal part that pops the kernels does come out but getting inside it to clean it is complicated, the unit itself, and the metal part. It makes you not want to use it as much knowing your going to have to spend so much time cleaning it. All in all he loved it so it was worth it!""}, {""review_5""=>""I was very excited to get this popcorn popper!!! See My friend has the larger model (the one with the wheels) and i just loved the popcorn from her machine!!! the popcorn was warm and YUMMY!!! When i decided to get one(the very next day) I went and ordered this one-the smaller unit because i do not have much floor space to have the larger unit in my kitchen. I was very bummed when I made the first batch most of the kernals did not pop-you need to cook like 2 or 3 batches then recook the unpopped kernals. also the plastic walls cracked and blistered. After 3 weeks I returned it and ordered the larger one for 50.00 more. ALSO get the 1 year service contract!!!!""}, {""review_6""=>""Bought this for my popcorn loving husband . It has been used at least 3 or more times a week for the last 9 months. He has mastered the technique of corn popping. Let the unit warm up first then add the popcorn carefully by turning the metal container towards you a bit while pouring the kernels in. He hasn't been burned yet. We have tried all brands of corn and none are any better than the next. Kernels left over are vacuum out with a shop vac, then wiped out; a 2 minute job. Buying one for my son's family for Christmas. One other comment the handle was complicated, the rule of righty tighty does not apply it is the opposite (go left or counter clockwise).""}, {""review_7""=>""I bought this popcorn maker based on the previous reviews. Boy was I 100% wrong - first this popcorn maker does not come with any popcorn - at leastt they should throw in 1 bag to say thanks!! It says it comes with a heating lamp - it is just a light bulb and it will never heat anything. Within the first 5 minutes the cheaply made plastic turning rod broke off and the metal ended up in the popcorn that barely even popped 1/2 way with kernals flying over the place - do yourself a favor get a hot-air popper for $20 and you'll do yourself a favor.""}, {""review_8""=>""I read all the reviews before buying, so I knew people were divided in their opinions. My family is a big fan of this popper. We have it sitting on the bar, and it nearly always has popcorn in it. We like the taste of the popcorn it makes, and we love having popcorn available to eat all the time. We found that by giving the oil a brief time to get hot before adding the popcorn we had very few \""old maids\"". My grandchildren are thrilled to always have popcorn available at my house.
